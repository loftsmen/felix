============
The flx tool
============

The executable `flx` is the primary tool used to interface components
of Felix for the purpose of building, testing, and running Felix programs.

To work, `flx` must be on your `$PATH` or must be invoked using an absolute
or relative pathname. 

It is your responsibility to choose how your OS finds the `flx` program.

Once `flx` starts, it should be able to find everything else it needs
automatically. By default, it uses the hard coded installation directory
to find things, which is `/usr/local/lib/felix/felix-version` on Unix
systems or `C:\usr\local\lib\felix\felix-version` on Windows, where
`felix-version` is the version of Felix installed.

You can override this hard coded default in several ways. The best
way is to create a configuration file named:

.. code-block:: text

  $HOME/.felix/config/felix.fpc

on Unix systems or

.. code-block:: text

  $USERPROFILE\.felix\config\felix.fpc

on Windows. This file just needs to specify the installation directory:

.. code-block:: text

    FLX_INSTALL_DIR=/home/users/me/work/felix

You can also use an environment variable with the same name.

The `flx` tool needs to know the location of a lot of components,
but it will derived most of these correctly from the single location
given by the `FLX_INSTALL_DIR`.

If you build Felix from the git repository, then from the top
level of the repository the installation directory is `build/release`
on Unix or `build/release` on Windows. That is a relative file name,
so you should set the variable to the corresponding absolute
filename, which would be given by 

.. code-block:: bash 

   echo $PWD/build/release

on Unix.

Basic Usage
===========

Once it is all set up, you should be able to run felix programs like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx hello.flx


This should work no matter what you current directory is, no matter where
the target file is, and it should not write anything important anywhere
except in $HOME/.felix/cache. You may find a couple of files like

.. code-block:: text

   flxg_stats.txt

floating about, that just contains some performance stats for the compiler,
you can delete it freely, or complain so I can stop polluting your system.

Stand alone executable
======================

To make a stand alone executable you should do this:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static -c -od . hello.flx

and you will find the executable afterwards in the current directory.
It will be named `hello` on Unix like systems or `hello.exe` on Windows.
You can then run it as usual by `./hello` on Unix, or just `hello` on Windows.

The :code:`--static` switch tells Felix to use static linkage, which is required
for a standalone executable. Normally Felix uses dynamic linkage.

The :code:`-c` switch tells Felix not to run the program.

The :code:`-od .` means to set the output directory to the current directory `.`.

You can also use :code:`-ox myhello` to set the output pathname to `myhello`
without specifying the extension. If you want to specify the extension
you can use :code:`-o myhello.exe` for example. The reason not to do this
should be clear, it makes the command OS dependent.

The reason for the :code:`-od` switch is more subtle: `flx` has a batch mode
which can run a whole set of programs based on a regular expression. In this
case you don't know the name of the file to output, since it is determined
by matching the regular expression against a whole directory of felix
programs. When you build Felix, the batch mode is used to run all the
regression tests.

Compiling Felix with added C++
==============================

Felix is specifically designed to work with C and C++.
To this end, you can write Felix programs which requires
C++ code you also supply. 

It is not the purpose of this document to describe how to
embed C++ into Felix. However let us assume you have Felix
code which depends on the C++ file `mycxx.cpp`. You can then
use this command to compile the C++ as well as the Felix code:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx mycxx.cpp myfelix.flx

This will compile the mycxx.cpp file using the same C++ compiler
Felix uses, generate C++ for myfelix.flx, and compile than,
and link the compiled object files together and run them.

Felix does dependency checking on the C++ file.
So it will not recompile the file if you do not change it.

Felix recognises the extension `.c` as C code,
and `.cpp`, `.cxx`, and `.cc` for C++ code.
We recommend you follow the convention that `.cxx` is used for
translation units containing `main()` function, and `.cpp` for
all others. This is the convention that Felix itself uses,
and it has an impact when autobuilding Felix itself, using
the specialised build tools.


Compiling Felix with added object files
=======================================

Sometimes you want to compile C++ code to object files yourself.
In this case you can just add the object files to the command line.
On x86_64 platforms in particular you need to take care that you
compile the file for the same operational model as you will use
with Felix. With static linkage, you can then run your program like:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static mycxx.o myfelix.flx

On Windows, object files have the extension `obj` instead.
If you leave out the :code:`--static` switch like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx mycxx.o myfelix.flx


you need to be sure you have compiled for relocatable code.
With g++ you may need the :code:`-fPIC` switch on Linux.
So-called position independent code (PIC) is slower than
position dependent code due to the ABI used by Linux,
together with the x86_64 architecture. This problem may
or may not arise on other platforms. Felix is very careful
to distinguish object files generated for static linkage
and those for dynamic linkage. When in doubt, use :code:`-fPIC`
because such code can usually also be statically linked.

You can also use the :code:`--obj=` switch:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static --obj=base myfelix.flx

This will add `base_static.o` to the link on Linux.
The suffix will be `_dynamic` for shared library build.
The extension will be `.obj` on Windows. This switch
just removes platform dependencies from the command line.


Compiling Felix with added libraries
====================================

You can also tell Felix to link extra libraries into
your program. The easiest way is to just put the filename
of the library on the command line. Make sure you compile
with the right model! 

This method of linkage always works for static linkage:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static libmylib.a myfelix.flx

should link your program against the give static link archive
on Linux. On Windows you would use:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static mylib.lib myfelix.flx

If you compile in dynamic mode, you can also give
library names like this, they will just be passed
as written to the C++ compiler. This is definitely
NOT recommended because it probably will not work.

A better way is to pass specific linker switches:

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static -Llibdir -lmylib.a myfelix.flx

This should work for both dynamic and static linkage.
On Unix, the switches shown are just passed directly
to the C++ compiler in link mode.

On Windows, the toolchain drivers use ths *same* switches,
but attempt to translate for MSVC++. For example:


.. code-block:: bash

    flx --static -Llibdir -lmylib.lib myfelix.flx

should work on Windows. Note that on Unix, the system
will look for libmylib.a whereas on Windows, it will
look for just mylib.lib, without the `lib` prefix.
MSVC++ uses different switches than Unix, but the toolchain
knows what :code:`-L` and :code:`-l` mean and map these switches
over to MSVC++ syntax.

Using specific switches like this is not recommended
except briefly for experimentation. It is much better
to register the library in the configuration database.


Compiling C++ only
==================

flx can compile and run C++ programs, programs witten
entirely without any Felix. For example:


.. code-block:: bash

    flx --c++ --static needed.cpp mainline.cxx -- args
 
All you need is to add the :code:`--c++` switch. When you run C++
like this you must remember that the Felix configuration
data base will not allow automatic linkage, as it does for
Felix programs, unless you modify the source.

We need to use the special symbol -- above separate
the list of C++ files and the arguments to the program.


Upgrading C++ for autolink
==========================

Felix can autolink C++ as well as Felix, using the Felix
configuration database. 

To enable autolink for C++, all you need to do is
put the requirements in the C++ somewhere, usually
in comments. For example

.. code-block:: cpp

    // @requires package mylib

will tell `flx` that this C++ file requires the package `mylib`.
When linking, `flx` will lookup the configuration database for
the file `mylib.fpc` and link against the binary library as
specified in that package, the same as it would for Felix programs.

This also works if you're building mixed C++ and Felix from
sources. The dependent packages are stored in a file associated
with the C++ source file name in the Felix cache, the same way
as for Felix packages specified by

.. code-block:: felix

    requires package "mylib";

in Felix sources. The upgrade to your C++ code has no impact
on your normal C++ compilation. The library will be linked
against automatically only if `flx` drives the C++ compilation
process.

Note that whilst the package requirements in C++ allow
autolinking, as well as providing search paths for header
files, you have to `#include` the header files in your
C++ in the usual way for C++. `flx` cannot currently
inject the header file includes into C++ you supply
because that would mean the C++ would not be compilable
by a C++ compiler, with any switches.

You do not need to do this if you embed the C++ inside
Felix.



Specifying Header file search paths
===================================

In order to compile C++ code, or to compile Felix code
which embeds C++ which requires header files, you can
specify a search path on the `flx` command line by:

.. code-block:: bash

   flx --static -Imydir myfile.cpp myfelix.flx

The :code:`-Imydir` switch extends the search paths used for C++
compilation for the C++ source file `myfile.cpp` as well
as for compiling the generated Felix C++ code.
In addition it *also* adds the directory to the Felix
library search path, so any Felix files in the specified
directory will be found.

Output Object Type
==================

The normal mode of operation of `flx` is to run specified
program. Execution can be inhibited by using the `-c` switch.

By default, `flx` generates a dynamic library, this is a shared
library on Unix with `.so` extension on Linux, or `.dylib` extenion
on OSX, on Windows, you get a `.dll`.

The action of a Felix *program* is just the side effects of the
initialisation of a library, that is, programs in Felix do not
really exist. Thus, a generated dynamic library can act both
as a program and also as an actual library.

Felix comes with two executables, `flx_run` and `flx_arun`
which can be used to run any dynamic Felix library.

If the :code:`--static` switch is set, then object files are generated
for static linkage. Otherwise, object files are generated for
dynamic linkage. Dynamic link object files on x86_64 Linux
systems require position independent code. Shared libraries 
must be built from dynamic link object files.

If :code:`--static` is set, then Felix links the object code for
either `flx_run` or `flx_arun` together with a stub adaptor
against the object file of your program, to produce a stand
alone executable.

To generate a static archive, use the :code:`--staticlib` switch.
This produces an `.a` file on UNix systems and a `.lib`
file on Windows. Note that this option implies :code:`--static`.
However, you can still make static link library from
dynamic object files. You need to first compile a dynamic
object file, and then on a separate command combine it
with any other dynamic object files using :code:`--staticlib`.

The :code:`--exe` switch tells `flx` to produce a static link
executable. This is only necessary in special circumstances.

The :code:`--nolink` switch inhibts linking so that the output object
is now an object file. It can be combined with `--static` to 
produce a non-position independent object file. Unless overriden,
`flx` produces static link object files with the source basename
suffixed by `_static` and dynamic link, position independent object
files with suffix `_dynamic`.

The :code:`--nocc` switch inhibits C++ compilation.

The :code:`--run-only` switch inhits all compilation and just runs the
program, ignoring any dependency checking. Obviously this will
fail if there is no program to run.


Output Location
===============

By default, the output object of a `flx` operation will be 
placed in the cache as `$HOME/.felix/cache/binary/pathname`
where `pathname` is the absolute pathname of the source
file with the extension replaced depending on the output
type and OS conventions, as well as the suffix for object
files if the output type is an object file produced for
a Felix source program.

The output pathname can be changed with the :code:`-o pathname` switch.
The given pathname is used instead of the default.
This is discouraged because it is not platform independent.

The output pathname can be changed with the `-ox pathname` switch.
In this case the pathname specified is used, except that the
appropriate extension is added automatically. This is prefered
over the plain :code:`-o` switch because it is platform independent.

The output pathname can also be changed with the :code:`-od dirname` switch.
In this case, the output object is placed in the specified directory,
with the name of the basename of the input file, and the appropriate
extension. This option is specifically design for use with batched
compilations where the filename is not known, because the files
to be processed are find by examining a directory and comparing filenames
found in it with a regular expression. However this switch is also useful
even if you know the filename because it avoid repeating it, and it
is useful in a script, because it avoids the string processing
required to remove the source extension.

When Felix translates a Felix program to C++ it normally puts
the C++ files into the cache. You can override this with
the :code:`--output_dir=dirname` switch. This is primarily useful
if you are cross compiling, where wish to capture the output 
files and ship them to another computer for C++ compilation.

The :code:`--bundle_dir=dirname` switch bundles *all* the generated
files for a program into a single directory. This includes
resource control files, C++ output files, object files,
executables, etc. This is sometimes useful when debugging,
or when you need to ship some or all of the generated files
to another computer.

The :code:`--cache_dir=dirname` changes the location of the cache
for this processing run. The cache is normally `$HOME/.felix/cache`.
This is useful is you are running flx in a special mode, and
it is *essential* if you are running `flx` simultaneously in
multiple processes to avoid clobbering of cached files.
Always use this if you are simultaneously building for different
targets.

By default, Felix knows about targets and if you change targets
the cache is cleaned automatically. Compiling from a clean cache
takes considerable extra time, since the whole library has to be
parsed and bound again.

Generic Performance Controls
============================

`flx` provides several performance controls. The :code:`--usage=level` control
is a generic control over the compilation process. The level can be
as follows:

hyperlight
----------

Ultra fast performance, all run time checks stripped.
Not recommended except for microbenchmarking tests.

production
----------

For code to be shipped to clients. High performance
run time at the expense of compile time, but includes
run time checks.

prototype
---------

For use developing a program, provides slightly faster
compilation at the expense of some run time performance,
and includes more run time checks and debugging controls.

debug, debugging
----------------

Provides the slowest output with the maximum debugging
support. Object files should be produces with debugging
information for debugger use. Comments in the generated
C++ are expanded. Synthesised objects are reduced to make
it easier to compare generated C++ with Felix sources.

Insecure run time debugging support is enabled. This includes
run time UDP debugging traces on Unix platforms.

C++ compiler switches
=====================

Felix recognises certain switches and ships them 
to your C++ compiler. Only a fixed set of switches
is recognised. In some cases, the switches may be
translated by the underlying toolchain.

-Lword, -lword
--------------

Shipped to the linker.

-fword, -Wword
--------------

Shipped to the compiler. Sets warning controls and
miscellaneous options. Compiler specific.

-Dword, -Dword=word
-------------------

Shipped to the compiler. Sets macros.
Translated for all compilers.

-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3
------------------

Shipped to the compiler. Tells the compiler which
performance model to compile with. May interfere
with instructions from Felix performance controls.

-Idir
-----

Shipped to the compiler and also used by Felix.
Specifies path for include file search.

--cflags=word
-------------

Shipped to compiler.

Debugging
=========

The switch :code:`--debug-flx` tells `flx` to emit
progress and debugging information, especially about
dependency checking.

The switch :code:`--compile-time` tells the Felix compiler
`flxg` to emit times for phases of execution. This is 
primarily useful to find exactly when a particular
bug in Felix program is detected, since some error
messages can be hard to understand.

The switch :code:`--debug-compiler` turns on full debugging
of the Felix compiler `flxg`. It is primarily for
the developer of the compiler itself, not users.

The `--echo` switch tells `flx` to print commands
it sends to the shell. You can also use the 
`FLX_SHELL_ECHO=1` environment variable to do this.
That variable affects all Felix programs, including
both `flx` itself and also any program it runs.

The :code:`--force-compiler` switch forces `flx` to
send Felix code to the Felix compiler `flxg` even
if `flx` thinks the program and its dependencies
are unchanged. This switch usually fails to achieve
its intent because `flxg` also does dependency
checking.

The :code:`--clean` switch wipes out the entire cache
forcing all compilation to run from scratch.

The :code:`--nofelix` switch is used to inhibit translation
of Felix code to C++. It does not prevent the other steps.
This switch is used so you can add diagnostic prints to
generated C++ code and rerun your C++ compilation, linkage,
and execution steps, without `flxg` clobbering your edits.


Test Suites
===========

The :code:`--stdin=filename` switch tells `flx` to that when
it runs a Felix program, to redirect standard input
so it comes from the specified file.

The :code:`--stdout=filename` switch tells `flx` that
when it runs a Felix program, to redirect standard
output to the specified file.

The `--expect=filename` switch tells `flx` that the
expected output of a program is in the specified file.
After the program has run, Felix checks the output
agrees with the expected output.

The :code:`--stdin`, :code:`--stdout` and :code:`--expect` switch
are similar but they use the pathname of the Felix
program with the extension replaced by `.input`,
`.stdout` and `.expect` respectively. These switches
are used to run test suites along with batch mode
compilation.

Batch Compilation
=================

`flx` can run a command multiple times, replacing the
primary Felix filename with a each name found in a
directory which matches a regular expression.

The :code:`--indir=dirname` switch sets the directory to
be examined for filenames. The :code:`--regex=regexp` sets
the regular expression used to filter the filenames.
This is a Google RE2 compilant regular expression.
Make sure you get the command line quoting correct.
The regexp must match the whole of the filename
relative to the directory specified in :code:`--indir`
switch.

The :code:`--nonstop` switch tells `flx` to run a batch
of compilations without stopping. By default,
it stops when an error is detected.

Felix compilation control
=========================

The :code:`--nostdlib` switch prevents Felix from automatically
including the Felix Standard Library. When you use this
switch, Felix is said to be running *raw*. Raw operation
is useful for teaching and experimentation because it
removes types and functions defined in the standard
library from consideration.

Note that the grammar, which is defined in the
library, is *not* disabled by using this switch.

The :code:`--import=filename` switch imports a file,
as if you had written `include "filename"` in *every* file.
This includes not just your main Felix program but every
file it includes, directly or indirectly.

The import switch is used to import macros, because macros
are lexically scoped to the file in which they are defined,
and cannot be exported to another file. By using the import
switch a file with macros in it is made available universally.
It is used by `flx` itself, to import the macros which specify
the host operating system, to enable platform dependent code
to be generated.

By convention, macro definition files use the extension `.flxh`.

The switch may also be given in the form :code:`--import=@filename`.
In this case the named file contains a list of files to be imported.


Targetting
==========

Felix has a number of switches to control targetting.

The :code:`--target-dir=dir` switch sets the directory
in which target subdirectories are located. It defaults
to the Felix installation directory. The :code:`--target-subdir=dir`
switch sets the subdirectory of the target directory which
contains the actual target configuration. It defaults to `host`.

If you have built a target for say `iPhone` you can build code
for the iPhone by

.. code-block:: bash

    flx --target-subdir=iPhone iphoneprogram.flx

This will compile the generated C++ with options and
header files specified in the configuration database
for that target, and link against libraries specified
in that target. So for example, on a Mac, you will 
end up with the above setup with an ARM binary suitable
for running on iOS, for the particular API for the version
of iPhone you set up. Felix does not help you set up
the environment, but once you have done so, `flx` will
compile and link automatically for any target.

A popular target on Linux is `clang`. You will normally
use the `host` target configured for `g++` however if you also
have the `clang` family of compilers you can target them instead
of, or as well as, `g++`.

Be aware, that changing targets clobbers your cache,
so if you are building for multiple targets it is a good idea
to have separate cache set up for each one.

The :code:`--toolchain=toolchain` switch can be used to change
your toolchain without changing your target. You must take care
with this option, because code generated by one toolchain
may or may not be compatible with code generated by another.

The `flx` tool keeps track of the toolchain which is used to
compile C++ codes. However, if you are supplying already
compiled object files, it cannot report a mismatch.

The :code:`--pkgconfig_path+=dir` switch *prepends* the 
specified directory to the search path used by the
internal `flx_pkgconfig` database query tool. It can
be used to enable searching for third party libraries
which have configuration data in a location outside
Felix. This is strongly recommended practice, since
rebuilding Felix destroys all data in the installation
directory before installing a clean upgraded copy.
However the command line switch is not the best way
to provide the location of this configuration database,
you should use the `$HOME/.felix/config/felix.fpc`
file instead.



Miscellaneous
=============

The :code:`--help` switch prints a list of switches.

The :code:`--where` switch tells the computed location
of the Felix installation directory.

The :code:`--time` switch causes `flx` to report how
long a program takes to run. The time does not include
compilation time, only execution time.

The :code:`--version` switch reports the current version
of Felix for which `flx` was compiled. Be warned, `flx`
can run other version of Felix. To find out the version
of Felix source library being used, you have to run a program
which prints the library version.

The :code:`--repl` switch runs a rudimentary line at a time
psuedo interpretive loop. You can use this for one liners.
The repl accepts multiple lines up to a blank line, then
compiles the code and runs it. The next paragraph of input
is appended to the code you already supplied and the
resulting text is compiled and run again.

The :code:`--felix=filename` switch loads a configuration
control file with a set of configuration settings.
This can be used to provide detailed customisation
of the configuration of the Felix system.

By default, `flx` looks for the file `$HOME/.felix/config/felix.fpc`
and loads that if it is found, as if it were specified with
the :code:`--felix` switch.
