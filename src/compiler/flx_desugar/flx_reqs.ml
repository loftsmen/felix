module CS = Flx_code_spec


(* Here, "name" is the name of the containing parent, eg if the statement being
 * processed is in a module X, then name will be "X". The name always exists.
 * If it is a top level thing, the name is a munged version of the program filename.
 *
 * The idea here is: if you write "requires fred" in a module X, then "_rqs_X"
 * will be an empty insertion with requirement "fred". We then make every symbol
 * in X depend on "_rqs_X" and thus propagate the dependency on "fred".
 *
 * If a module Y is nested in a module X, then "_rqs_Y" will have a requirement
 * on "_rqs_X", so the symbols in a nested module will inherit any requirements
 * of the parent of the module which is their parent.
 *
 * Adding the dependency of Y on X is called making a bridge.
 *
 * BUG: TO BE FIXED: The top level "module" never gets an insertion!
 * So the bridges built to that module fail. This only happens if
 * we're processing a nested scope for which a bridge is generated,
 * some some of our regression tests pass, but any with a function in them
 * fail (since function have scopes and therefore generate bridges)
 *
 * The root rqs thing has to be manually inserted by the top level caller
 * of desugar, which is the one inventing the top level module name from
 * the program
